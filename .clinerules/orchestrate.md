> Multi-agent parallel development orchestrator. Reads task manifests, builds dependency DAGs, generates sprint plans, assigns scoped work to parallel agents, and coordinates review gates. Trigger on "/orchestrate", "plan sprints", "parallel agents", "assign sprint", or "orchestrate tasks".

# Orchestrate — Multi-Agent Parallel Development

## Operating Rules (read first)

1. **Use file tools, not shell, for directories and files.** Create `.autoclaw/orchestrator/...` paths with the host's file/write tool. Do NOT use `mkdir -p`, `touch`, or `New-Item`.
2. **Forward slashes in paths.** Always.
3. **Idempotency.** `plan` with an existing manifest re-generates sprints in place. `assign` on an already-assigned sprint updates the assignment.
4. **Scope isolation is sacred.** Never assign overlapping file scopes to parallel agents in the same sprint. The planner MUST detect and prevent conflicts.
5. **Output discipline.** Confirm in ≤5 lines: what changed, sprint count, agent assignments, next action. No reasoning narration.

## On Invocation

Determine the sub-command from the user's message:

- `init` → **Initialize orchestrator config and manifest**
- `plan` / `plan --manifest <path>` → **Generate sprint plans from manifest**
- `assign` / `assign <sprint>` → **Assign a sprint to agents**
- `status` → **Show orchestration progress**
- `review <sprint>` → **Trigger review for a completed sprint**
- `merge <sprint>` → **Merge an approved sprint branch**
- `next` → **Assign the next available sprint**
- No sub-command + task description → **Quick plan: infer manifest from description**

---

## init — Initialize Orchestrator

1. Read `.autoclaw/orchestrator/config.yaml`. If it exists, report current config and skip creation.
2. If missing, create the default config structure:
   - `.autoclaw/orchestrator/config.yaml` — global settings (agents, git, planning, gates, review, scope, logging)
   - `.autoclaw/orchestrator/manifests/` — directory for task manifests
   - `.autoclaw/orchestrator/sprints/` — directory for generated sprint plans
   - `.autoclaw/orchestrator/reviews/` — directory for review reports
   - `.autoclaw/orchestrator/logs/` — directory for execution logs
3. If a spec `tasks.md` exists (e.g., `.kiro/specs/*/tasks.md`), offer to generate a manifest from it.
4. Confirm: "Orchestrator initialized. Create a manifest in `.autoclaw/orchestrator/manifests/` or run `/orchestrate plan` to generate sprints."

## plan — Generate Sprint Plans

### Input
Read the manifest YAML from the specified path (default: first `.yaml` in `manifests/`).

### Algorithm

**Phase 1: Parse & Validate**
- Parse manifest YAML into task list with `id`, `name`, `depends_on`, `scope`, `effort`, `subtasks`.
- Validate: no duplicate IDs, all `depends_on` references exist, no empty scopes.

**Phase 2: Build Dependency Graph (DAG)**
- Nodes = tasks, Edges = `depends_on` relationships.
- Detect cycles using Kahn's algorithm. If cycle found, report error with the cycle path.

**Phase 3: Level Assignment (Topological Sort)**
- Level 0: tasks with no dependencies (in-degree 0).
- Level N: tasks whose dependencies are all in levels < N.
- Tasks at the same level CAN execute in parallel.

**Phase 4: Scope Conflict Detection**
- For each pair of tasks at the same level, check if their `scope` glob patterns can match overlapping files.
- Conflicting tasks at the same level must be separated into different sprints or assigned to different agents with explicit merge ordering.

**Phase 5: Sprint Assignment (Bin Packing)**
- Read `agents.work_agents` from config (default: 4).
- Read `planning.max_tasks_per_agent` and `planning.max_subtasks_per_sprint` from config.
- For each level, assign tasks to agents respecting:
  - Scope isolation (no overlap within same sprint)
  - Effort capacity per agent per sprint
  - `constraints.mutual_exclusion` from manifest
  - `constraints.affinity` from manifest (co-locate related tasks on same agent)
- Priority heuristics:
  1. Critical path length (longest downstream chain first)
  2. Downstream dependents (unblocks most tasks)
  3. Effort (larger tasks start early to avoid tail latency)
  4. Affinity (co-locate related tasks)

**Phase 6: Migration Range Allocation**
- If tasks include database migrations, allocate sequential non-overlapping ranges per agent per sprint.
- Range size from `git.conflict_prevention.migration_range_size` config.

**Phase 7: Output**
- Write sprint plan YAML to `.autoclaw/orchestrator/sprints/sprint-{N}.yaml` for each sprint.
- Write summary to `.autoclaw/orchestrator/sprints/plan-summary.yaml`.

### Sprint YAML Format
```yaml
sprint: 1
level: 0
status: pending  # pending, assigned, in_progress, review, approved, merged
assignments:
  - agent: WA-1
    tasks:
      - id: "task-11"
        name: "zippyctl CLI foundation"
        subtasks: [...]
    scope:
      - "cmd/zippyctl/**"
      - "internal/cli/**"
    branch: "feat/sprint-1-wa1-zippyctl"
    migration_range: null
  - agent: WA-2
    tasks:
      - id: "task-13"
        name: "Secrets vault integration"
        subtasks: [...]
    scope:
      - "internal/secrets/**"
    branch: "feat/sprint-1-wa2-secrets"
    migration_range: null
dependencies_met: true
estimated_days: 4
```

### Plan Summary Format
```yaml
project: "zippypanel"
total_tasks: 75
total_sprints: 9
total_agents: 4
critical_path_length: 5
estimated_total_days: 36
sprints:
  - number: 1
    level: 0
    tasks: 4
    agents: [WA-1, WA-2, WA-3, WA-4]
    status: pending
```

Confirm: "Generated {N} sprints for {M} tasks across {A} agents. Critical path: {P} sprints. Run `/orchestrate assign 1` to start Sprint 1."

---

## assign — Assign Sprint to Agents

1. Read the sprint YAML from `sprints/sprint-{N}.yaml`.
2. Verify all dependency sprints are in `merged` status. If not, report which sprints are blocking.
3. For each agent assignment in the sprint:
   - Render the sprint assignment from `templates/sprint-assignment.md` with the agent's tasks, scope, branch name, and migration range.
   - Write the rendered assignment to `.autoclaw/orchestrator/sprints/sprint-{N}-{agent}.md`.
4. Update sprint status to `assigned`.
5. Confirm: "Sprint {N} assigned to {agents}. Assignment files written. Each agent should read their assignment and begin work."

---

## status — Show Progress

Read all sprint YAMLs and the plan summary. Display:

```
Orchestration Status — {project}
═══════════════════════════════
Sprint 1: ██████████ merged (4/4 tasks)
Sprint 2: ████████░░ in_progress (WA-1: done, WA-2: review, WA-3: working, WA-4: working)
Sprint 3: ░░░░░░░░░░ pending (blocked by Sprint 2)
...
Progress: 12/75 tasks complete (16%)
Critical path: Sprint 5 of 9
```

---

## review — Trigger Review

1. Read the sprint YAML. Verify status is `in_progress` or all agents have signaled completion.
2. For each agent's completed work:
   - Render the review checklist from `templates/review-checklist.md`.
   - Run configured quality gates from `config.yaml` (`go build`, `go vet`, `go test`, etc.).
   - Write gate results to the review file.
3. Write review report to `.autoclaw/orchestrator/reviews/sprint-{N}-review.md`.
4. Set verdict: `APPROVED`, `MINOR_ISSUES`, or `CRITICAL_ISSUES`.
5. If `CRITICAL_ISSUES`: update sprint status to `review` and list required fixes.
6. If `APPROVED` or `MINOR_ISSUES`: update sprint status to `approved`.
7. Confirm: "Sprint {N} review complete. Verdict: {verdict}. {details}"

---

## merge — Merge Approved Sprint

1. Verify sprint status is `approved`.
2. For each agent's branch (in dependency order):
   - Merge to develop branch using `--no-ff`.
   - Run `go mod tidy` if Go files changed.
   - Run full test suite.
3. Update sprint status to `merged`.
4. Check if next sprint's dependencies are now met.
5. Confirm: "Sprint {N} merged. Sprint {N+1} is now unblocked. Run `/orchestrate assign {N+1}` to continue."

---

## next — Assign Next Available Sprint

1. Find the first sprint with status `pending` whose dependencies are all `merged`.
2. Run the `assign` flow for that sprint.
3. If no sprint is available, report: "All sprints assigned or blocked. Run `/orchestrate status` for details."

---

## Quick Plan (no sub-command)

If the user describes tasks without a sub-command:
1. Infer task structure from the description.
2. Generate a temporary manifest.
3. Run the `plan` flow.
4. Offer to save the manifest for future use.

---

## State Tracking

The orchestrator maintains state in sprint YAML files (status field) and optionally in `.autoclaw/orchestrator/state.json`:

```json
{
  "project": "zippypanel",
  "current_sprint": 2,
  "total_sprints": 9,
  "tasks_complete": 12,
  "tasks_total": 75,
  "agents": {
    "WA-1": { "status": "working", "sprint": 2, "tasks": ["task-19"] },
    "WA-2": { "status": "review", "sprint": 2, "tasks": ["task-20"] },
    "WA-3": { "status": "working", "sprint": 2, "tasks": ["task-21"] },
    "WA-4": { "status": "idle", "sprint": null, "tasks": [] }
  },
  "last_updated": "2026-05-02T12:00:00Z"
}
```

---

## Error Handling

- **Cycle detected**: Report the cycle path and refuse to plan. User must fix manifest.
- **Scope conflict**: Report conflicting tasks and their overlapping patterns. Suggest splitting or sequencing.
- **Missing dependency**: Report which `depends_on` ID doesn't exist in the manifest.
- **Gate failure**: Report which gate failed, with command output. Do not auto-merge.
- **Agent timeout**: If an agent hasn't signaled completion within `estimated_days * 2`, flag as stalled.

---

## Integration with Other Skills

- **KDream**: Orchestrator progress is logged to KDream's memory. KDream ticks can check for stalled sprints.
- **AutoBuild**: Quality gates can be defined as AutoBuild workflows.
- **MAteam**: Individual sprint assignments can be executed by MAteam's Researcher → Coder → Reviewer → Verifier pipeline.
